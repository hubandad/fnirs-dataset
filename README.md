# Public fNIRS Dataset

*fNIRS is a non-invasive, portable and low-cost optical neuroimaging technology with considerable spatial and temporal resolution. Due to the late emergence of fNIRS technology compared to EEG, the research results using this technology are not at the same level as those using EEG. A search on Google datasets shows that there is no systematic public dataset for fNIRS.*

*The following public datasets are compiled from Google Scholar literature.*

**1. Defenderfer 2019; fNIRS data files for event-related vocoding/background noise study**

A total of 38 fNIRS datasets shared by the Defenderfer team from the University of Tennessee. The dataset contains functional near-infrared data obtained when subjects completed noise coding speech tasks and background white noise speech perception tasks.

**6. Benitez 2020, The influence of extra-cerebral vasculature on the efficacy of the short-separation regression approach applied to fNIRS data analysis.**

A dataset of fNIRS was released by Maastricht University to verify the impact of SSR on the quality and sensitivity of fNIRS data. Previous studies have solved the problem of low signal-to-noise ratio in fNIRS signals by using additional information recorded from outside areas of the brain through short-distance channels (SDC) to correct them. This method, called Short Separation Regression (SSR), can improve both signal quality and sensitivity for detecting task-related brain activation with fNIRS. However, it is currently unclear whether the effectiveness of SSR depends on factors such as vascular proximity/density near channels.

The research team combined physiological anatomy, function, and vascular imaging magnetic resonance imaging data with continuous wave fNIRS data to quantify the impact of SSR on signal quality and sensitivity for detecting task-related brain activation while investigating how vascular proximity/density affects its effectiveness.

**7. San Juan 2017, Replication Data for: fNIRS RSFC in Tinnitus**

This fNIRS dataset was shared by the San Juan team on Harvard Dataverse. The research team used fNIRS technology to study changes in functional connectivity of human auditory and non-auditory brain regions during resting state before and after auditory stimulation under normal hearing, bilateral subjective tinnitus, and control conditions. The related research results were published in PLoS ONE in 2016.
